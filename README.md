Marines MUD 3D
==============
MarinesMUD 3D is an adventure and FPS multiplayer game. It is based on AlternativMUD server (separate project on Github), which I have been developing for past few years. As the server was ready for 3D, I have started developing the MarinesMUD 3D which is the client. 

## Quickstart
+ To start the server please follow the instructions on http://github.com/Jblew/alternativ-mud (needed only if you want multiplayer)
+ To run the game:
   1. Checkout the project
   2. Open Unity
   3. Select File > Open Project
   4. In project-select window click on "Open Other...", select the main directory of MarinesMUD and click open.
   5. As the project is opened, in the "Project" tab (located somewhere in the Unity window), select Scenes directory, and click on "Passage" scene.
   6. Click "Play" button on the top of Unity window.
   7. (Debug) Observe the "Console"
